%% 1.3 DATA COLLECTION PRINCIPLES

% 10 (OI4, 1.14)

% 11 ODD (OI4, 1.13)

\eocesol{(a)~The population of interest consists of babies born in Southern California. The sample consists of the 143,196 babies born between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. \\
	(b)~Assuming that the sample is representative of the population of interest, the results of the study can be generalized to the population. The findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships because the study was an observational study, not an experiment.}


% 12 oi_biostat

% 13 ODD (OI4, 1.15)

\eocesol{(a)~The population of interest consists of asthma patients who rely on medication for asthma treatment. The sample consists of the 600 asthma patients ages 18-69 who participated in the study. \\
	(b)~The sample may not be representative of the population because study participants were recruited, an example of a convenience sample. Thus, the results of the study may not be generalizable to the population. The findings can be used to establish causal relationships because the study is an experiment conducted with control, randomization, and a reasonably large sample size.}

% 14 EVEN (OI4, 1.30) edited

% 15 oi_biostat, adapted from chicks_antioxidants

\eocesol{(a)~Experiment. \\
	(b)~The experimental group consists of the chicks that received vitamin supplements. The control group consists of the chicks that did not receive vitamin supplements. \\
	(c)~Randomization ensures that there are not systematic differences between the control and treatment groups. Even if chicks may vary in ways that affect body mass and corticosterone levels, random allocation essentially evens out such differences, on average, between the two groups. This is essential for a causal interpretation of the results to be valid.}

% 16 EVEN (OI4, 1.34) edited

% 17 ODD (OI4, 1.21)

\eocesol{(a)~Observational study. \\
	(b)~Answers may vary. One possible confounding variable is the wealth of a country. A wealthy country's citizens tend to have a higher life expectancy due to a higher quality of life, and the country tends to have a higher percentage of internet users because there is enough money for the required infrastructure and citizens can afford computers. Wealth of a country is associated with both estimated life expectancy and percentage of internet users. Omitting the confounder from the analysis distorts the relationship between the two variables, such that there may seem to be a direct relationship when there is none.}

% 19 ODD (OI4, 1.23) context edited

\eocesol{(a)~Simple random sampling is reasonable if 500 students is a large enough sample size relative to the total student population of the university. \\
	(b)~Since student habits may vary by field of study, stratifying by field of study would be a reasonable decision. \\
	(c)~Students in the same class year may have more similar habits. Since clusters should be diverse with respect to the outcome of interest, this would not be a good approach.}

% 20 EVEN (OI4, 1.38)

% 21 ODD (OI4, 1.39)

\eocesol{(a)~Non-responders may have a different response to this question, e.g.
	parents who returned the surveys likely don't have difficulty spending time
	with their children. \\
	(b)~It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years
	later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters
	(as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might be in a lower socio-economic class than the respondents. \\
	(c)~This is an observational study, not an experiment, so it is not advisable to draw conclusions about causal relationships. The relationship may be in the other direction; i.e., that these people go running precisely because they do not have joint problems. Additionally, the data are not even sufficient to provide evidence of an association between running and joint problems because data have only been collected from individuals who go running regularly. Instead, a sample of individuals should be collected that includes both people who do and do not regularly go running; the number of individuals in each group with joint problems can then be compared for evidence of an association.}

\eocesol{The lead author's statements are not accurate because he or she drew conclusions about causation (that increased alcohol sales taxes lower rates of sexually transmitted infections) from an observational study. In addition, although the study observed that there was a decline in gonorrhea rate, the lead author generalized the observation to all sexually transmitted infections.}

% 24 EVEN (OI4, 1.40)

\eocesol{(a)~Randomized controlled experiment.
	(b)~Explanatory: treatment group (categorical, with 3 levels). Response variable:

%% 1.4 NUMERICAL DATA

% 26 EVEN (OI4, 2.8)

% 27 ODD (OI4, 2.7)

\eocesol{(a)~The two distributions have the same median since they have the same middle number when ordered from least to greatest. Distribution 2 has a higher IQR because its first and third quartiles are farther apart than in Distribution~2. \\
	(b)~Distribution 2 has a higher median since it has a higher middle number when ordered from least to greatest. Distribution 2 has a higher IQR because its first and third quartiles are farther apart than in Distribution~1. \\
	(c)~Distribution 2 has a higher median since all values in this distribution are higher than in Distribution 1. The two distributions have the same IQR since the distance between the first and third quartiles in each distribution is the same. \\
	(d)~Distribution 2 has a higher median since most values in this distribution are higher than those in Distribution 1. Distribution 2 has a higher IQR because its first and third quartiles are farther apart than those of Distribution 1.}


% 28 EVEN (OI4, 2.10)

% 29 ODD (OI4, 2.11)

\eocesol{(a)~The distribution is bimodal, with peaks between 15-20 and 25-30. Values range from 0 to 65.  \\
	(b)~The median AQI is about 30. \\
	(c)~I would expect the mean to be higher than the median, since there is some right skewing.}


% 30 oi_biostat, nursing home data, Pset 1, Q1


% 31 ODD (OI4, 2.17)

\eocesol{(a)~The median is a much better measure of the typical amount earned by these 42
	people. The mean is much higher than the income of 40 of the 42 people. This is
	because the mean is an arithmetic average and gets affected by the two extreme observations. The median does not get effected as much since it is robust to
	outliers.
	(b)~The IQR  is a much better measure of variability in the amounts earned by nearly
	all of the 42 people. The standard deviation gets affected greatly by the two high
	salaries, but the IQR is robust to these extreme observations.}

% 32 EVEN (OI4, 2.18)

%% 1.5 CATEGORICAL DATA

% 33 oi_biostat

\eocesol{(a)~These data are categorical. They can be summarized numerically in either a frequency table or relative frequency table, and summarized graphically in a bar plot of either counts or proportions. \\
	(b)~The results of these studies cannot be generalized to the larger population. Individuals taking the survey represent a specific subset of the population that are conscious about dental health, since they are at the dentist's office for an appointment. Additionally, there may be response bias; even though the surveys are anonymous, it is likely that respondents will feel some pressure to give a "correct" answer in such a setting, and claim to floss more often than they actually do.}

% 34 EVEN (OI4, 2.22)



%% 1.6 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES

% 35 ODD (OI4, 2.1) edited

\eocesol{(a)~Yes, there seems to be a positive association between lifespan and length of gestation. Generally, as gestation increases, so does life span. \\
	(b)~Positive association. Reversal of the plot axes does not change the nature of an association.}

% 36 EVEN (OI4, 2.2)

% 37 oi_biostat

\eocesol{(a)~75\% of the countries have an adolescent fertility rate less than or equal to 75.73 births per 1,000 adolescents. \\
	(b)~It is likely that the observations are missing due to the Iraq War and general instability in the region during this time period. It is unlikely that the five-number summary would have been affected very much, even if the values were extreme; the median and IQR are robust estimates, and the dataset is relatively large, with data from 188 other countries. \\
	(c)~The median and IQR decreases each year, with Q1 and Q3 also decreasing.}

% 39 oi_biostat, cite anger_chd paper

\eocesol{(a)~4,371/8,474 = 0.56 $\rightarrow$ 56\% \\
	(b)~110/190 = 0.58 $\rightarrow$ 58\% \\
	(c)~27/633 = 0.04 $\rightarrow$ 4\% \\
	(d)~53/3,110 = 0.02 $\rightarrow$ 2\% \\
	(e)~Relative risk: $\frac{27/633}{53/3,110} = 2.50$. Yes, since the relative risk is greater than 1. A relative risk of 2.50 indicates that individuals with high trait anger are 2.5 times more likely to experience a CHD event than individuals with low trait anger. \\
	(f)~Side-by-side boxplots, since blood cholesterol level is a numerical variable and anger group is categorical.}

\eocesol{(a)~$\frac{1}{4}$. \\
	Solution 1: A colorblind male has genotype $X^{-}Y$. He must have inherited $X^{-}$ from his mother (probability of $\frac{1}{2}$) and $Y$ from his father (probability of $\frac{1}{2}$). Since these are two independent events, the probability of both occuring is $(\frac{1}{2}) (\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{4}$. \\
	Solution 2: Determine the possibilities using a Punnett square. There are 4 equally likely possibilities, one of which is a colorblind male. Thus, the probability is $\frac{1}{4}$.

\eocesol{(a)~0.25. Let $H$ represent the event of being a high school graduate and $F$ represent the event of being a woman. $P(H) = P(H \textrm{ and } W) + P(H \textrm{ and } W^C) = P(H|W)P(W) + P(H|W^C)P(W^C) = (0.20)(0.50) + (0.30)(0.50) = 0.25$. \\

	(c)~0.25. Let $X$ represent the event of having at least a Bachelor's degree, where $B$ represents the event of attaining at most a Bachelor's degree and $G$ the event of attaining at most a graduate or professional degree.  $P(X|W^C) = P(B|W^C) + P(G|W^C) = 0.16 + 0.09 = 0.25$. \\
	(d)~0.26. $P(X|W) = P(B|W) + P(G|W) = 0.17 + 0.09 = 0.26$. \\
	(e)~0.065. Let $X_W$ be the event that a woman has at least a Bachelor's degree, and $X_M$ be the event that a man has at least a Bachelor's degree. Assuming that the education levels of the husband and wife are independent, $P(X_W \textrm{ and } X_M) = P(X_W) \times P(X_M) = (0.25)(0.26) = 0.065$. This assumption is probably not reasonable, because people tend to marry someone with a comparable level of education.

% 7 oi_biostat, from urgent_care_visits

\eocesol{(a)~Let $C$ represent the event that one urgent care center sees 300-449 patients in a week. Assuming that the number of patient visits are independent between urgent care centers in a given county for a given week, the probability that three random urgent care centers see 300-449 patients in a week is $[P(C)]^3 = (0.288)^3 = 0.024$. This assumption is not reasonable because a county is a small area with relatively few urgent care centers; if one urgent care center takes in more patients than usual during a given week, so might other urgent care centers in the same county (e.g., this could occur during flu season). \\
	(b)~$2.32 \times 10^{-7}$. Let $D$ represent the event that one urgent care center sees 450 or more patients in a week. Assuming independence, the probability that 10 urgent care centers throughout a state all see 450 or more patients in a week is $[P(D)]^{10} = (0.217)^{10} = 2.32 \times 10^{-7}$. This assumption is reasonable because a state is a large area that contains many urgent care centers; the number of patients one urgent care center takes in is likely independent of the number of patients another urgent care center in the state takes in. \\
	(c)~No, it is not possible, because it is not reasonable to assume that the patient visits for a given week are independent of those for the following week.}

\eocesol{(a)~If the class is not graded on a curve, they are independent. If graded on a
	curve, then neither independent nor disjoint -- unless the instructor will only give
	one A, which is a situation we will ignore in parts~(b) and~(c).
	(b)~They are probably not independent: if you study together, your study habits
	would be related, which suggests your course performances are also related.
	(c)~No. See the answer to part~(a) when the course is not graded on a curve. More
	generally: if two things are unrelated (independent), then one occurring does not
	preclude the other from occurring.}

	(b)~As prevalence of prostate cancer increases by age group, PPV also increases. However, with rising prevalence, NPV decreases.\\
	(c)~The probability that a man has prostate cancer, given a positive test, necessarily increases as the overall probability of having prostate cancer increases. If more men have the disease, the chance of a positive test result being a true positive increases (and the chances of the result being a false positive decreases). The decreasing NPV values follow similar logic: if more men have the disease, the chance of a negative test being a true negative decreases (and the chances of the result being a false negative increases).  \\
	(d)~Lowering the cutoff for a positive test would result in more men testing positive, since men with PSA values 2.5 ng/ml to 4.1 ng/ml were not previously classified as testing positive. Since the sensitivity of a test is the proportion who test positive among those who have disease, and the number with disease does not change, the proportion will increase, except in the rare and unlikely situation where the additional positive tests are among only men without the disease.}

	- $P(M_2 \cap D_2 \cap R) = 0.012$, $P(M_2 \cap D_1 \cap R) = 0.045$

	- $P(M_2 \cap D_2 \cap B) = 0.012$, $P(M_2 \cap D_1 \cap B) = 0.045$

	- $P(D_1| M_0, B) = P(D_1| M_1, B) = 0.05$, $P(D_2 | M_0, B) = P(D_2 | M_1, B) = 0.01$ \\
	i.~Calculate $P(M_2 \cap D^C \cap R)$.

	\begin{align*}
	P(M_2 \cap D^C \cap R) =& P(D^C|M_2, R)P(M_2|R)P(R) \\
	=& \textcolor{red}{P(D^C|M_2, R)}(0.10)(0.60) \\
	\end{align*}

	To calculate $P(D^C|M_2, R)$, first calculate $P(D_1|M_2, R)$ and $P(D_2|M_2, R)$ from the joint probabilities given in the problem, then apply the complement rule.

	\[P(D_1|M_2, R) = \dfrac{P(M_2 \cap D_1 \cap R)}{P(M_2 \cap R)} = \dfrac{0.045}{(0.10)(0.60)} = 0.75\]

	\[P(D_2|M_2, R) = \dfrac{P(M_2 \cap D_2 \cap R)}{P(M_2 \cap R)} = \dfrac{0.012}{(0.10)(0.60)} = 0.20\]

	Back to the original question...

	\begin{align*}
	P(M_2 \cap D^C \cap R) =& P(D^C|M_2, R)P(M_2|R)P(R) \\
	=& \textcolor{red}{P(D^C|M_2, R)}(0.10)(0.60) \\
	=& [1 - (0.75 + 0.20)](0.10)(0.60) \\
	=& (0.05)(0.10)(0.60) \\
	=& 0.003
	\end{align*}

	The probability that an Australian cattle dog has a bilateral mask, no hearing deficits, and a red coat is 0.003. \\
	ii.~Calculate $P(D^C|M_2, B)$.

	\begin{align*}
	P(D^C|M_2, B) =& 1 - [P(D_1|M_2, B) + P(D_2|M_2, B)] \\
	=& 1 - \left[ \dfrac{P(D_1 \cap M_2 \cap B)}{P(M_2 \cap B)} + \dfrac{P(D_2 \cap M_2 \cap B)}{P(M_2 \cap B)} \right] \\
	=& 1 - \left[ \dfrac{0.045}{P(M_2|B)P(B)} + \dfrac{0.012}{P(M_2|B)P(B)} \right] \\
	=& 1 - \left[ \dfrac{0.045}{(0.35)(0.40)} + \dfrac{0.012}{(0.35)(0.40)} \right] \\
	=& 0.593
	\end{align*}

	The proportion of bilaterally masked Blue Heelers without hearing deficits is 0.593. \\
	iii.~Calculate $P(D|R)$ and $P(D|B)$.

	\begin{align*}
	P(D|R) =& P(D \cap M_0|R) + P(D \cap M_1|R) + P(D \cap M_2 |R) \\
	=& [1 - P(D^C|R, M_0)](P(M_0|R) + [1 - P(D^C|R, M_1)](P(M_1|R) + [1 - P(D^C|M_2, R)](P(M_2|R) \\
	=& (1 - 0.60)(0.50) + (1 - 0.60)(0.40) + (1 - 0.05)(0.10) \\
	=& 0.455
	\end{align*}

	\begin{align*}
	P(D|B) =& P(D \cap M_0|B) + P(D \cap M_1|B) + P(D \cap M_2 |B) \\
	=& [P(D_1|B, M_0) + P(D_2|B, M_0)](P(M_0|B) + [P(D_1|B, M_0)+ P(D_2|B, M_0)](P(M_1|B) \\
	& \quad  + [1 - P(D^C|M_2, B)](P(M_2|B) \\
	=& (0.05 + 0.01)(0.40) + (0.05 + 0.01)(0.25) + (1 - 0.593)(0.35) \\
	=& 0.181
	\end{align*}

	The prevalence of deafness among Red Heelers is higher, at 0.455 versus 0.181 in Blue Heelers. \\
	iv.~Calculate $P(B|D^C)$.

	\begin{align*}
	P(B|D^C) =& \dfrac{P(B \cap D^C)}{P(D^C)} \\
	=& \dfrac{P(D^C|B)P(B)}{P(D^C \cap B) + P(D^C \cap R)} \\
	=& \dfrac{[1 - P(D|B)]P(B)}{[1 - P(D|B)]P(B) + [1 - P(D|R)]P(R)} \\
	=& \dfrac{(1 - 0.181)(0.40)}{(1 - 0.181)(0.40) + (1 - 0.455)(0.60)} \\
	=& 0.50
	\end{align*}

	The probability that a dog is a Blue Heeler given that it is known to have no hearing deficits is 0.50.

	(d)~No, he is not correct. The probability calculated in c) deals only with Brooklyn: the probability that there are 10 or more cases in Brooklyn for a single year. It does not say anything about cases in other boroughs. If we assume independence between boroughs, the probability that the official is referring to is:

	$P(X = 0 \ \text{in other boroughs}) \times P(X \geq 10 \ \text{in Brooklyn})$.

Let $Y$ represent the event that in a single year, 10 or more cases of osteosarcoma are observed in Brooklyn. If we assume independence between years, then $Y$ follows a binomial distribution with $n = 5$ and $p$ of success as caculated in part c); $P(Y = 1) = 0.020$.

The values and the marginal distribution for the partner's cost do not change, so the expected value and standard deviation will not change.

\eocesol{(a) i.~False. There is a 5\% chance that any 95\% confidence interval does not contain the true population mean days out of the past 30 days that U.S. adults experienced poor mental health.
	ii.~False. The population parameter $\mu$ is either inside or outside the interval; there is no probability associated with whether the fixed value $\mu$ is in a certain calculated interval. The randomness is associated with the interval (and the method for calculating it), not the parameter $\mu$. Thus, it would not be reasonable to say there is a 95\% chance that the particular interval (3.40, 4.24) contains $\mu$; this interpretation is coherent with the statement in part iii. of this question.
	iii.~True. This is the definition of what it means to be 95\% confident.
	iv.~True. The interval corresponds to a two-sided test, with $H_0: \mu = 4.5$ days and $H_A: \mu \neq 4.5$ days and $\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. Since $\mu_0$ of 4.5 days is outside the interval, the sample provides sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
	v.~False. We can only be confident that 95\% of the time, the entire interval calculated contains $\mu$. It is not possible to make this statement about $\overline{x}$ or any other point within the interval.
	vi.~False. The confidence interval is a statement about the population parameter $\mu$, the mean days out of the past 30 days that all US adults experienced poor mental health. The sample mean $\overline{x}$ is a known quantity.
	(b)~The 90\% confidence interval will be smaller than the 95\% confidence interval. If we are less confident that an interval contains $\mu$, this implies that the interval is less wide; if we are more confident, the interval is wider. Think about a theoretical "100\%" confidence interval---to be 100\% confident of capturing $\mu$, then the range must be all possible numbers that $\mu$ could be.

\eocesol{(a)~Since $p < 0.05$, there is statistically significant evidence that the population difference in BGC is not 0.

(b)~The 95\% confidence interval is $\overline{d} \pm t^\star \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}$. Since the mean of the differences is equal to the difference of the means, $\overline{d} = 1.70 - 0.586 = 1.114$. The test statistic is $t = \frac{\overline{d}}{s_d/\sqrt{n}}$, so the standard error ($s_d/\sqrt{n}$) can be solved for: $s_d/\sqrt{n} = \overline{d}/t = 1.114/2.64 = 0.422.$ The critical $t$-value for a 95\% confidence interval on a $t$-distribution with $16 - 1 = 15$ degrees of freedom is 2.13.

A negative value would represent a patient's deviant T scores increasing after the intervention.
	(b)~Let $Y$ be the change in MMPI score for a participant in this study, $X_{neutral}$ a variable with value 1 for participants assigned to the neutral tape and 0 otherwise, and $X_{therapeutic}$ a variable with value 1 for participants in the emotional neutral group and 0 otherwise.  The population-level equation is $E(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_{neutral}X_{neutral} + \beta_{therapeutic}X_{therapeutic}$.  For these data, the estimated model equation is $\widehat{y} = -3.21 + 6.07 X_{neutral} + 9.43 X_{therapeutic}$.
	(c)~The predicted difference scores $\widehat{y}$ for a patient receiving the neutral tape will be $\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_{neutral}X_{neutral} + b_{therapeutic}X_{therapeutic}= -3.21 + 6.07 + 0 = 2.86.$

	(b)~Since the coefficient of the pre-intervention score is positive, post-intervention scores tend to increase as the pre-intervention score increases.
	(c)~Yes.  The $t$-statistic for the coefficient of \texttt{pre} is 4.05 and is statistically significant.
	(d)~In this model, treatment is a factor variable with three levels and the intervention with no tape is the baseline treatment that does not appear in the model. For a participant with \texttt{pre} = 70 and  no tape, the predicted value of \texttt{post} is $28.41 + 0.66(73) - 5.73(1) = 70.86$
	(e)~For a given value of \texttt{pre}, the coefficient of \texttt{treatmentNeutral}
	is the predicted change in \texttt{post} between an participant without a tape and one with the emotionally neutral tape.  The model implies that \texttt{post} will be  5.7 points lower with the emotionally neutral tape.

(b)~The coefficient for \texttt{pre} is the predicted increase in post score associated with a 1 unit increase in pre-score for individuals in the absent arm, while the coefficients of the interaction terms for neutral and therapeutic represent the difference in association between pre and post scores for individuals in those groups. For example, an individual in the neutral group is expected to have a $1.28 - 0.99 = 0.29$ point increase in post score, on average, per 1 point increase in pre-score. The coefficients of the slopes for \texttt{neutral} and \texttt{therapeutic} are differences in intercept values relative to the intercept for the model, which is for the baseline group (absent).
(c)~Absent: $\widehat{post} = -17.58 + 1.28(pre)$
	Neutral: $\widehat{post} = -17.58 + 67.75 + 1.28(pre) - 0.99(pre) = 50.17 + 0.29(pre)$

(d)~These data suggest there is a statistically significant difference in association between pre- and post-intervention scores by treatment group relative to the group that did not receive any treatment. The coefficients of both interaction terms are statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.05$. Since the slopes are smaller than the slope for the treatment absent group, the data demonstrate that individuals in either treatment group show less increase in MMPI score than occurs when no treatment is applied.

	(c)~Under the null hypothesis that the two slope coefficients are 0, all three interventions would have the same mean difference in MMPI scores.  This is the same as the null hypothesis for an ANOVA with three groups ($H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$), which states that all three population means are the same.
	(d)~The assumptions for multiple regression and ANOVA are outlined in Sections~\ref{modelCheckMultipleRegression} and \ref{anovaAndRegrWithCategoricalVariables}, respectively. The assumptions for the two models are the same, though they may be phrased differently. The first assumption in multiple regression is linear change of the mean response variable when one predictor changes and the others do not change. Since each of the two predictor variables in this model can only change from 0 to 1, this assumption is simply that the means in the three groups are possibly different, which is true in ANOVA.  The second assumption in regression is that the variance of the residuals is approximately constant.  Since the predicted response for an intervention group is its mean, the constant variance assumption in regression is the equivalent assumption in ANOVA that the three groups have approximately constant variance. Both models assume that the observations are independent and that the residuals follow a normal distribution.  This is a very long way of saying that the two models are identical!}

\eocesol{(a)~We want to check for a majority (or minority),
    so we use the following hypotheses:
    \begin{align*}
    &H_0: p = 0.5
    &&H_A: p \neq 0.5
    \end{align*}
    We have a sample proportion of $\hat{p} = 0.55$
    and a sample size of $n = 617$ independents. \\
    Since this is a random sample, independence
    is satisfied.
    The success-failure condition is also satisfied:
    $617 \times 0.5$ and $617 \times (1 - 0.5)$
    are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion
    $p_0 = 0.5$ for this check in a one-proportion
    hypothesis test). \\
    Therefore, we can model $\hat{p}$ using a
    normal distribution with a standard error of
    \begin{align*}
    SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}
      = 0.02
    \end{align*}
    (We use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$
    to compute the standard error for a
    one-proportion hypothesis test.)
    Next, we compute the test statistic:
    \begin{align*}
    Z = \frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5
    \end{align*}
    This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062,
    and a p-value of $2 \times 0.0062 = 0.0124$. \\
    Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05,
    we reject the null hypothesis.
    We have strong evidence that the support
    is different from 0.5, and since the data
    provide a point estimate above 0.5,
    we have strong evidence to support this
    claim by the TV pundit. \\
(b)~No.
    Generally we expect a hypothesis test
    and a confidence interval to align,
    so we would expect the confidence interval
    to show a range of plausible values
    entirely above 0.5.
    However, if the confidence level is
    misaligned (e.g. a 99\% confidence level
    and a $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level),
    then this is no longer generally true.}

\eocesol{(a)~Under the null hypothesis of no association, the expected cell counts are 9.07 and 7.93 in the wait together and wait alone groups, respectively, for those considered "high anxiety" and 6.93 and 6.07 in the wait together and wait alone groups, respectively, for those considered "low anxiety".
	(b)~Use the hypergeometric distribution with parameters $N = 30$, $m = 16$, and $n = 17$; calculate $P(X = 12)$. Consider the "successes" to be the individuals who wait together, and the "number sampled" to be the people randomized to the high-anxiety group. The probability of the observed set of results, assuming the marginal totals are fixed and the null hypothesis is true, is 0.0304.
	(c)~More individuals than expected in the high-anxiety group were observed to wait together; thus, tables that are more extreme in the same direction also consist of those where more people in the high-anxiety group wait together than observed. These are tables in which 13, 14, 15, or 16 individuals in the high-anxiety group wait together.

	(d)~Let $p_1$ represent the population proportion of individuals waiting together in the high-anxiety group and $p_2$ represent the population proportion of individuals waiting together in the low-anxiety group. Test $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ against $H_A: p_1 \neq p_2$. Let $\alpha = 0.05$. The two-sided $p$-value is 0.063. There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis; the data do not suggest there is an association between high anxiety and a person's desire to be in the company of others.

		\begin{tabular}{r|rr}
			\hline
			& CVD & No CVD \\
			\hline

	(b)~The odds of CVD for patients older than 50 years when diagnosed with diabetes is  5/55 = 0.09.  The odds of CVD for the patients younger than 50 years at diabetes onset is 15/25 = 0.60.  The relative odds (or odds ratio, OR) is 0.09/0.60 = 0.15.

	(c)~ The odds of CVD for someone with late onset diabetes is less than 1/5 that of people with earlier onset diabetes. This can be explained by the fact that people with diabetes tend to build up plaque in their arteries; with early onset diabetes, plaque has longer time to accumulate, eventually causing CVD.

	(d)~$H_0: OR = 1$.

	(e)~The chi-square test can be used to test $H_0$ as long as the conditions for the test have been met.  The observations are likely independent; knowing one person's age of diabetes onset and CVD status is unlikely to provide information about another person's age of diabetes onset and CVD status. Under $H_0$, the expected cell count for the lower left cell is (60)(20)/100 = 12, which is bigger than 5; all other expected cell counts will be larger.

	(f)~Since the study is not a randomized experiment, it cannot demonstrate causality. It may be the case, for example, that CVD presence causes earlier onset of diabetes. The study only demonstrates an association between cardiovascular disease and diabetes.}

\eocesol{(a)~No.  This is an example of outcome dependent sampling. Subjects were first identified according to presence or absence of the CNS disorder, then queried about use of the drug.  It is only possible to estimate the probability that someone had used the drug, given they either did or did not have a CNS disorder.

	(b)~The appropriate measure of association is the odds ratio.

	(c)~The easiest way of calculating the OR for the table is the cross-product of the diagonal elements of the table: $\left[(10)(4000)\right]/\left[(2000)(7)\right] = 2.86$.  Using the definition, it can be calculated as:

	\[\hat{OR} = \frac{\frac{\hat{P}(\text{CNS} | \text{ Usage})}{1 - \hat{P}(\text{CNS} | \text{ Usage})}}{\frac{\hat{P}(\text{CNS} | \text{ No Usage})}{1 - \hat{P}(\text{CNS} | \text{ No Usage})}} = \frac{ad}{bc} = \frac{(10)(4000)}{(2000)(7)} = 2.86 \]


	(d)~The odds ratio has the interpretation of the relative odds of presence of a CNS disorder, comparing people who have used the weight loss drug to those who have not. People who have used the weight loss drug have odds of CNS that are almost three times as large as those for people who have not used the drug.

	(e)~Fisher's exact test is better than the chi-square test.  The independence assumption is met, but the expected cell count corresponding the presence of a CNS disorder and the use of the drug is 5.68, so not all the expected cell counts are less than 10.

\eocesol{(a)~The $p$-value is 0.92; there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no association. These data are plausible with the null hypothesis that green tea consumption is independent of esophageal carcinoma.
	(b)~Since the study uses outcome-dependent sampling, the odds ratio should be used as a measure of association rather than relative risk. The odds ratio of esophageal carcinoma, comparing green tea drinkers to non-drinkers, is 1.08; the odds of carcinoma for those who regularly drink green tea are 8\% larger than the odds for those who never drink green tea.

(a)~Let $\hat{p}_1$ represent the observed proportion who experience the outcome of interest among those assigned to placebo and $\hat{p}_2$ the observed proportion who experience the outcome of interest among those assigned to tofacitinib; $\hat{p}_1 = 42/145 = 0.290$ and $\hat{p}_2 = 26/144 = 0.181$. The 95\% CI is $(-0.0527, -.2709)$.
(b)~Test $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ against $H_A: p_1 \neq p_2$. Let $\alpha = 0.05$. With the $z$-test method, the $z$-statistic is 2.186. The two-sided $p$-value is $P|Z| \geq 2.186 = 0.0289$, which is smaller than 0.05. There is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis; the evidence suggests that tofacitinib is an effective treatment compared to placebo.
(c)~The 95\% CI for the risk ratio is (1.0422, 2.469). There is a larger risk of death or respiratory failure during the follow-up period for individuals on the placebo group than for individuals on tofactinib that could be as high as over twice the risk or as low as 1.04 times the risk.

(a)~Given that the upper left cell has value 4 and that the margins are fixed, the other values in the table (going clockwise) are 1, 5, and 1.
(b)~The relative risk for response, comparing treatment to control, is $(4/5)/(1/6) = 4.8$.
(c)~There is only one table more extreme whose results favor treatment; the table in which all 5 individuals in the treatment group show a response.
(d)~The one-sided $p$-value consists of the probability of the observed table plus the probability of the table with a 5 in the upper left cell. Thus, the $p$-value is $\frac{{5 \choose 4}{6 \choose 1}}{{11 \choose 5}} + \frac{{5 \choose 5}{6 \choose 0}}{{11 \choose 5}} = 0.067$.
